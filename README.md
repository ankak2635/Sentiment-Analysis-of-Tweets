# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets
Explores and runs a sentiment analysis using VADER approach on about 25k tweets mentioning @Dell to label each tweet as either positive, negative or neutral.

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)

* Uses "bag of words" approach
    1. Removes stop words
    2. each word is scored and combined to give a total score
    3. However, this model does not account for the relations between texts

This is work in progress notebook, more analysis to come! 
Thanks
